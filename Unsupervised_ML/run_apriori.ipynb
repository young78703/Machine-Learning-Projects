    "For example, the first row of the DataFrame shows that the combination of `herb & pepper` and `nan` appears together in 1.6% of the transactions, and that 32.3% of the transactions that contain `herb & pepper` and `nan` also contain `ground beef`. The lift value of 3.291994 indicates that the occurrence of `ground beef` is 3.29 times more likely when `herb & pepper` and `nan` appear together, compared to when they appear independently."

    "A brief explanation of how support, confidence, and lift are computed in the Apriori algorithm:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Support: The support of an itemset is the proportion of transactions in the dataset that contain that itemset. It is computed as the number of transactions containing the itemset divided by the total number of transactions in the dataset. For example, if there are 1000 transactions in the dataset, and the itemset {A, B} appears in 100 of those transactions, then the support of {A, B} is 0.1 or 10%.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Confidence: The confidence of an association rule A -> B is the proportion of transactions containing A that also contain B. It is computed as the number of transactions containing both A and B divided by the number of transactions containing A. For example, if there are 100 transactions containing A, and 50 of those transactions also contain B, then the confidence of the rule A -> B is 0.5 or 50%.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Lift: The lift of an association rule A -> B measures the degree of dependence between A and B, and is computed as the ratio of the observed support of A and B to the expected support of A and B if A and B were statistically independent. If the lift is greater than 1, it indicates that the occurrence of A and B together is more likely than would be expected by chance, and suggests a positive correlation between A and B. If the lift is less than 1, it indicates that A and B are less likely to occur together than would be expected by chance, and suggests a negative correlation between A and B. If the lift is equal to 1, it indicates that A and B are statistically independent."
